# DELHI METRO RAIL APP

## METHODOLOGY

The application will take information about source station and destination station from the user and provide it with the fare and shortest metro route to reach the destination. It will also be having a metro map for commuter’s better navigation.

To implement this idea, our team will be using the Graph data structure where each station will represent a node which will be containing certain information regarding that station like its name, its metro corridor and the lines which it connect, its nearest metro stations. The distance between the two stations will be represented by the edge connecting the two nodes. Now each node will be connected to other nodes using the edges and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting stations. By using an algorithm, the shortest path between the source station and the destination station will be determined and accordingly the fare will be calculated on the basis of total distance between the two stations.

Finally, the metro route between the two stations and total fare would be displayed to the commuter.

##  REQUIREMENTS

	The project will be build using JAVA language. Any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Microsoft Windows 7 or above will be the software requirements.
	A computer system with 2 GB RAM or above will be the hardware requirement to run the application.
	
## PROJECT CONTRIBUTION

	The project will simplify the lives of people by making the metro transportation more efficient and simple. It will help the tourists as well as delhiites to travel more conveniently by knowing their destination routes with accurate fare. Also, the tedious way to look at the metro map and figuring the destination will be abandoned. This will also save a lot of commuter’s time. The application can be also pronounced as “Metro made Simple”.
